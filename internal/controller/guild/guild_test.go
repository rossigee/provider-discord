	// NOTE: Comprehensive controller tests would require refactoring the external
	// struct to accept an interface instead of *clients.DiscordClient.
	// This would allow proper mocking of Discord API calls.
	//
	// Example refactoring needed:
	// 1. Define DiscordClientInterface with all needed methods
	// 2. Change external.service to use the interface
	// 3. Make clients.DiscordClient implement the interface
	// 4. Then we can properly mock all the controller methods
	//
	// For now, we rely on the Discord client tests to ensure the API
	// interactions work correctly.
